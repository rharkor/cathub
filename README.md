## Lint Quality

To generate a linting report with ESLint, navigate to the "api", "app", or "packages" directory in your project.

Then, run the following command:


```bash
npm run lint-report
```

This will create HTML report files at the root of the project inside the "report" directory. You can open this file in your browser to view detailed insights into the quality of the code and any linting issues.
